               Supports 'now' for in 5 minutes, and 'now!' for immediately.
        end: The datetime on which the bot will announce the tournament results,
             after closing and tallying the results of any still-open puzzles.
             Same format as `start`.
        metametric: The equation determining how much of a puzzle's points each
                    player will receive (highest metametric receives full puzzle points).
                    Can be put in "`quotes AND backticks`" to avoid discord formatting it.

                        your_metric, best_metric, your_rank_idx, num_solvers

                    The metametric will be auto-normalized to give each player

            announcement post (name, end date and metametric will also be automatically

        """Add a puzzle to the tournament.

        round_name: e.g. "Round 1" or "Bonus 1".
        metric: The equation a player should minimize.
                A player's final score for the round will be the top metric
                score divided by this metric score.
                Allowed terms:
                    <Any real number>, cycles, reactors, symbols, waldos, waldopath, bonders.

                    Instr counts:
                        arrows, grabs, drops, grab_drops, rotates, syncs, senses, flip_flops,
                        bonds, bond_pluses, bond_minuses, fuses, splits, swaps,
                        input_instrs, output_instrs, <zone>_input_instrs, <zone>_output_instrs.
                    Instr hit counts:
                        arrow_hits, sync_hits, rotate_hits, bond_plus_hits, bond_minus_hits,
                        fuse_hits, split_hits, swap_hits.
                    Misc:
                        pipe_segments: How many pipe segments the solution has.
                        recycler_pipes: Number of pipes attached to a recycler.
                        piped_molecules: How many times a molecule got sent from a reactor into a pipe.
                        max_symbols: The max symbol count of any one reactor.
                        max_waldo_symbols: The max symbol count of any waldo in any reactor.
                        symbol_footprint: Count of reactor cells with any symbol in them.
                        max_symbol_footprint: The max symbol_footprint of any one reactor.
                        max_waldomiles: The max, for any waldo, of its paths' total length, where a cell-width is 1.
                                        Similarly to waldopath, this includes all visually-traced paths, even unused.
                                        Unlike waldopath, waldomiles can have up to 2 units of length per cell, in the
                                        case of branching or criss-crossing paths.

                Allowed operators/fns: ^ (or **), /, *, +, -, max(), min(),
                                       log() (base 10)
                Parsed with standard operator precedence (BEDMAS).
                Can be put in "`quotes AND backticks`" to avoid discord formatting it.
                E.g.: "`cycles + 0.1 * symbols + bonders^2`"
        points: # of points that the first place player will receive.
                Other players will get points proportional to this based
                on their relative metric score.
        start: The datetime when the puzzle will be announced and submissions opened.
               ISO format, default UTC.
               E.g. the following are all equivalent: 2000-01-31, "2000-01-31 00:00",
                    2000-01-30T19:00:00-05:00
               Supports 'now' for in 5 minutes, and 'now!' for immediately.
        end: The datetime on which submissions will close and the results will be
             announced. Same format as `start`.
             If excluded, puzzle is open until the tournament is ended (e.g. the
             2019 tournament's 'Additional' puzzles).
        max_cycles: The maximum cycle count of submissions to allow validation for.
                    Default 1,000,000.
        [Attachment] *.puzzle:
            A .puzzle file containing the puzzle export string, which will be
            attached to the puzzle announcement post.
        [Attachment] *.txt: Optional, since discord for desktop doesn't support
            multiple attachments. Add this instead via !tournament-puzzle-update.
            A .txt file containing a description to be included in the puzzle
